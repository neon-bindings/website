This guide will help you get your system set up for building Neon projects. If you already have everything installed and are looking to write your first Neon code, try the [Hello, World!](hello-world.md) guide.

## Install Node

Neon requires Node.js and supports **the latest Node version and all LTS releases**. If you don't already have Node.js installed, or don't have a supported version, go to the [Node.js web site](https://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions.

## Install Rust

Neon requires Rust for development. If you don't already have Rust installed, or don't have a supported version, go to the [Rust web site](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) for installation instructions.

Rust may have additional dependencies depending on your target platform (for example, Visual Studio on Windows).
