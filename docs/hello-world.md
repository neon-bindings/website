[Examples](https://github.com/neon-bindings/examples)

This guide will walk you through writing, building, and running your first Neon project. We'll try to walk you through each step carefully, but if you want to skip ahead, you can always go straight to the [full demo](https://github.com/neon-bindings/examples/tree/main/examples/cpu-count) in the examples repository.

Our first project will be a tiny module that returns a number indicating the number of CPUs in the current machine. If you're not familiar with systems programming, don't panic! We'll be using [Sean McArthur](https://seanmonstar.com/)'s [num_cpus](https://crates.io/crates/num_cpus) crate to do all the heavy lifting for us, and we'll just return the number it gives us.

Even this simple example already demonstrates some of Neon's usefulness: Rust's [crate ecosystem](https://crates.io/) is younger than npm but, growing quickly and is already full of useful and unique libraries. A library like `num_cpus` could be useful, for example, as a hint for tuning the size of a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) pool in an [Electron app](./electron-apps/).

# Creating a New Project

The first thing we have to do is create our new `cpu-count` Neon project:

```shell
npm init neon cpu-count
```

This will ask us a series of questions similar to the ones asked by `npm init`. When it completes, the tool will have created a `cpu-count` directory with the following layout:

```text
cpu-count/
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

The first thing to notice about this layout is that **a Neon project is both a Node package, and a Rust crate**.

The Rust source lives in `src/`, but JavaScript that augments Rust can live side-by-side.

Similar to how [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) can be adjusted to target a minimum JavaScript version, Neon can target a Node version by adjusting the `napi` feature in the `Cargo.toml`. By default, `npm init neon` will use the currently installed Node version.

```toml
[dependencies.neon]
features = ["napi-6"]
```

See the [Node-API version matrix](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_node_api_version_matrix) for more details.

# Building and Running

We haven't yet implemented anything, but just to see that `npm init neon` produced a complete, minimal Neon project, let's try building it:

```shell
cd cpu-count
npm install
```

The build process generates a handful of files:

- `target/`: The build directory used by Rust
- `index.node`: The compiled Neon module

An easy way to clean up build artifacts is to run:

```shell
cargo clean
```

Once we've built the project, we can try running it:

```shell
node
> require('.').hello()
hello node
```

# Adding a Rust Dependency

Let's add a Rust dependency on the [num_cpus](https://crates.io/crates/num_cpus) crate. In `Cargo.toml`, add the following lines:

```toml
[dependencies]
num_cpus = "1"
```

This tells Cargo, Rust's build tool, to fetch a version of the `num_cpus` crate that is semver-compatible with `1`. (The `package.json` equivalent would be `"num_cpus": "^1"`.)

# Implementing our Function

Next we can replace the sample `hello` function that was generated by `npm init neon` with the function we actually want. Instead of returning a string, our function should return a JavaScript number. So we'll use [`cx.number()`](https://docs.rs/neon/*/neon/types/struct.JsNumber.html) helper. Since `cx.number()` expects a Rust [`f64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html) (i.e., a 64-bit floating-point number), and [`num_cpus::get()`](https://docs.rs/num_cpus/1.4.0/num_cpus/fn.get.html) returns a [`usize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.usize.html) (i.e., a pointer-sized integer), we'll use Rust's`as` operator to cast to convert the integer to floating-point:

```rust
use neon::prelude::*;

fn get_num_cpus(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsNumber> {
    Ok(cx.number(num_cpus::get() as f64))
}
```

A few more things to note about this code:

- The `cx` argument to `get_num_cpus`: this contains information about the function call, such as the arguments and the value of `this`.
- The [`JsResult`](https://docs.rs/neon/*/neon/result/type.JsResult.html) output type: this is a Rust [`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) type that indicates whether the function returned (`Ok`) or threw a JavaScript exception (`Err`). You can learn more in the [Errors](errors) docs. It also tracks the lifetime of the returned _handle_. 
- The `cx.number()` function tells the JavaScript garbage collector that we need to keep the value we allocate alive long enough to return it to the caller of `get_num_cpus`.

Finally, we'll modify the code that `npm init neon` created for us to set up the module exports with this function instead of the initial "hello world" function it created for us:

```rust
#[neon::main]
fn main(mut cx: ModuleContext) -> NeonResult<()> {
    cx.export_function("get", get_num_cpus)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This tells Neon to initialize the module when it's first loaded by creating a JavaScript function implemented with the `get_num_cpus` function we defined above and exporting it as a module property named `"get"`.

You can see the full [`lib.rs`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/examples/blob/main/examples/cpu-count/src/lib.rs) file in the examples repository.

# Try it Out!

Now we should be able to rebuild the project:

```shell
npm run build -- --release
```

This will create a release build for us. Release builds take longer to compile, but the final library executes more quickly. Assuming we didn't make any mistakes, we can test out our new Neon module at the Node console from the root of our project directory:

```shell
node
> const cpuCount = require('.')
> cpuCount.get()
4
```

Keep in mind that the result of calling `cpuCount.get()` will vary based on the machine you run this demo on—by design!
