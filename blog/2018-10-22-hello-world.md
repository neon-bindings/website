This is the first post from the rewritten website for neon. This site is based on a static site generator, called [docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/), and it is specifically for documentation. Here are some of the goals of this new website some of the benefits that come with choosing this stack:

The goal of this new website is to;

- Replace the existing website, which is based on jekyll
- Use newer web stack and infra: React, docusarus, babel, webpack, etc
- Easy to maintain docs ([Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) makes this easy)
- Built-in search functionality with algolia ([Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) makes this easy)
- Ready for Translations ([Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) makes this easy)
